## Prerequisites

To complete this task successfully, ensure you have:

* A valid Workfront and Workfront Fusion license
* An AEM user with right to access Dev Console to retrieve the service credentials
* Network connectivity to both AEM and Workfront Fusion services
* Required user roles and access credentials (administrator access recommended)

## Architecture Overview

The integration between AEM Forms and Workfront Fusion follows a webhook-based architecture:

1. **AEM Forms**: Captures form submissions and sends data to Workfront Fusion
2. **Webhook**: Acts as the communication bridge between the two systems
3. **Workfront Fusion**: Processes the form data and executes automated workflows
4. **Data Flow**: JSON-based data exchange with proper authentication and error handling


## Implementation Steps


### Step 1: Configure AEM Forms Environment

**Objective:** Set up the AEM Forms environment for Workfront Fusion integration

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Access AEM Forms Author Instance**
   - Navigate to your AEM Forms author instance: 
   - Log in with administrator credentials
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions for form configuration
   - Verify you're in the correct environment (author vs publish)

2. **Create or Configure Adaptive Form**
   - Go to **Forms & Documents** in the AEM navigation menu
   - Click **Create** â†’ **Adaptive Form** or select an existing form
   - Configure form fields according to your business requirements
   - Set up form validation rules and submission handling
   - Configure form properties and metadata

3. **Configure Form Submission Settings**
   - Open the form properties by right-clicking the form
   - Navigate to the **Submission** tab
   - Configure the submission action to point to Workfront Fusion
   - Set up proper authentication and endpoint configuration
   - Configure data mapping and transformation rules


### Step 2: Set Up Workfront Fusion Integration

**Objective:** Configure Workfront Fusion to receive form submissions from AEM

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Access Workfront Fusion**
   - Log in to your Workfront Fusion account: 
   - Navigate to the **Scenarios** section
   - Create a new scenario for AEM Forms integration
   - Set up proper organization and team access

2. **Configure Webhook Trigger**
   - Add a **Webhook** trigger to your scenario
   - Copy the webhook URL for use in AEM configuration
   - Configure the webhook to accept JSON data from AEM
   - Set up webhook security and authentication
   - Configure webhook response handling

3. **Set Up Data Processing**
   - Add modules to process the incoming form data
   - Map form fields to Workfront Fusion data structures
   - Configure any required data transformations
   - Set up error handling and retry logic
   - Configure data validation and filtering


### Step 3: Establish Connection Between Systems

**Objective:** Connect AEM Forms with Workfront Fusion for seamless data flow

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Configure AEM Form Submission Action**
   - In your Adaptive Form configuration
   - Set the submission URL to your Workfront Fusion webhook
   - Configure authentication headers if required
   - Test the connection to ensure proper communication
   - Set up SSL/TLS certificate validation

2. **Set Up Error Handling**
